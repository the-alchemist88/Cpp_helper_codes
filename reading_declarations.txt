Points to follow for reading the code:

1) Start reading from the variable name
2) Start inwards and move outwards
3) Reading is from right to left
4) Read the right first without going over the parenthesis
5) Then go left without going over the other parenthesis
6) [] – read as array of
7) * – read as pointer to
8) () – read as function returning


char *ptr : ptr is a pointer to char type

int **ptr:  ptr is a pointer to a pointer to int type

int (*ptr)[5]: ptr is a pointer to array of size 5 where each element is of int type.

char *ptr[5]: ptr is an array of size 5 where each element points to pointer to character type.

char *(*ptr)[5]: ptr is a pointer to array of size 5 where each element is a pointer to char type

void *fun(): fun is a function returning a pointer to void.

int (*fun)(): fun is a pointer to function returning int type.

int *(*ptr)()[]: ptr is a pointer to function returning an array of pointer to integers

int (*(*ptr[])())(void) – ptr is array of pointer to function returning pointer to int that takes no parameters

char (*(*var())[])(): var is a function returning a pointer to an array of pointer to function returning char.

int *(*(**fun [][5])())[]: fun is an array[5] of pointer to pointer to function returning pointer to array of pointer to int

float (*(*ptr[5])())(void (*)(char, char *)): ptr is an array of size 5 where each element is a function pointer that takes no parameter and returns a pointer to function that takes two parameters and returns float
