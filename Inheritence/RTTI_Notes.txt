RTTI(Run Time type Identification)
*---------------------------------------------------------------*

Run-time type information (RTTI) is a mechanism that allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution. RTTI was added to the C++ language because many vendors 
of class libraries were implementing this functionality themselves. This caused incompatibilities between libraries. Thus, it became obvious that support for run-time type information
was needed at the language level.

The main advantage of dynamic polymorphism is being able to use the virtual base class(pointer or reference) without knowing its dynamic type. 
This eliminates the dependancy of new codes(or top layer code -- overriders) to old codes(or low layer codes -- base class virtual functions).

Tools for determining the dynamic type at runtime(RTTI tools):

1)dynamic_cast
---------------

-dynamic_cast operator examines whether downcasting is safe or not.

-Typically used for casting pointer/reference to base class type, to pointer/reference to toderived class type(downcasting).

void fun(Car* cptr) // assume that Volvo is publicly derived from Car class so this functian can operate virtual dispatch
{
	if(auto* vptr = dynamic_cast<Volvo*>(cptr)) // if, at run-time, cptr points to an Volvo object then dynamic_cast is succssful and aptr points to that object
	{								    		// otherwise dynamic_cast returns nullptr
		// code
	}
}										   

-dynamic_cast operand(expression inside paranthesis) should be related to a polymorphic type, otherwise compiler will complain

-If downcasting is applied by reference semantics, there won't be any check the whether dynamic_cast operator successfully worked or not. If unsuccessful,
then compiler will throw exception(std::bad_cast) in this case. Usually pointer semantics are preffered.

void car_game(Car& cr) 
{
	try
	{
		auto vr = dynamic_cast<Volvo>(cr);
		vr.open_sunroof();
		(void)getchar();
	}
	
	catch(const exception& ex)
	{
		cout << "exception caught: " << ex.what() << '\n'; 
	}
	
}				

int main()
{
	Car* cpr = create_random_car();
	fun(*car_game);
}

-The dynamic_cast operator scans down the hierarchy: if the dynamic type that will be operand to dynamic_cast, is a type of a derived class that is lower
in a multilevel inheritance hierarchy than the type to be casted, this is not a syntax error, it is converted to operand's dynamic type

class Volvo : public Car
{
public:
	void foo()
	{
		cout << "Volvo foo()\n";
	}
};

class VolvoXC90 : public Volvo
{
public:
	void foo()
	{
		cout << "VolvoXC90 foo()\n";
	}
};

void fun(Car* cptr)
{
	if (auto* dptr = dynamic_cast<Volvo*>(cptr))
	{
		dptr->foo();
	}
}		

int main()
{
	VolvoXC90 vxcp;

	fun(&vxcp);	//  by this call dynamic_cast will cast cptr into VolvoXC90*, not Volvo*. Output : VolvoXC90 foo()
}


2)typeid
----------

#include <typeinfo>

Usage:
	typeid(type)
	typeid(expr)

- The types of expressions that will be operand of typeid operator, don't have to be related with dynamic types unlike dynamic_cast operator. 

- The expression of typeid operator is unevaluated context as in sizeof operator.

- An expression formed with the tpyeid operator is actually a const reference to an object of type std::type_info.

	typeid(Myclass); // type of this expression is const type_info
	const type_info& ti = typeid(Myclass); // correct syntax
	
	Default ctor of class type_info doesn't exist and copy ctor is deleted. Only way to use an object of type std::type_info is to use typeid operator.
	
	There are two commonly used function of type_info class:
	
1)	operator== (to compare two types)
	
		class Myclass{};
		Myclass mx;
		
		auto b = typeid(Myclass) == typeid(mx);
		
2)  name() (returns const char*)

	returns the type as C-string. Implementation dependant(depends on compiler)
	
- The behaviour of typeid operator depends on whether the types are polymorphic or non-polymorphic. Ex:
 
class Base{
	public:
	virtual ~Base() = default; 
};

class Der : public Base
{

};

int main()
{
	Der myder;
	Base* baseptr = &myder;
	std::cout << (typeid(*baseptr) == typeid(Der)) << '\n'; // if Base was non-polymorphic then this expression would print 0, it would be valid but related to static type
	std::cout << typeid(*baseptr).name(); // if Base was non-polymorphic this would print class Base
}

Output:

1
Der
													

- Unlike dynamic_cast operator, typeid operator doesn't scan down the inhertance hierarchy, it can be used to find exact match of types. Therefore dynamic_cast has more cost than
typeid operator. 


- Since typeid doesn't do any casting, static_cast can be used to access the derived class member functions. static_cast is valid for the types that are in the same hierarchy but 
programmer always need to check whether the dynamic_types match or not. Without checking the type, it can be undefined behaviour.

void car_game(Car* cptr) 
{
	
	if(typeid(Volvo) == typeid(*cptr))
	{
		auto vptr = static_cast<Volvo*>(cptr)
	}

	vp->open_sunroof();
	(void)getchar();
}				

int main()
{
	Volvo vol;
	car_game(&vol);
}

RTTI Tools(DYNAMIC_CAST & TYPEID) Summary
*-----------------------------------------------------*

- dynamic_cast operator tests whether downcasting (conversion from base class to derived class) is possible.
- The expression that is the operand of dynamic_cast must be of a polymorphic type.
- dynamic_cast also scans down the hierarchy, i.e. if there is an inherited class from the derived class that is the operand and the function(*Car) will
be transformed to its type if it is passed to it.

- The expression that is the operand of the typeid operator does not have to be of a polymorphic type.
- If it is a polymorphic type, the dynamic type concept is applied and the type is determined at runtime, if it is not polymorphic, the static type concept is taken as a basis.
- typeid also does not scan the hierarchy, it is based on only the type of the expression which is its operand.

- The static_cast operator can be used to determine at compile time whether two different classes are in the same inheritance hierarchy.
It will be legal to cast classes in the same hierarchy to each other with static_cast, so there will be no need to examine the header files.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

-There is a way to check if two classes in the same hierarchy in compile time, static_cast.

static_cast<Der*>((Base*)0); // if this is valid, they Base and Der are in the same hierarchy

-There a few keywords that form unevaluated context(for expressions which compiler doesn't produce code):

sizeof, typeid, decltype

 unevaluated context has two features:
 
1)Eliminates side effects( sizeof(x++) --> x doesn't get incremented)

2)Eliminates undefined behaviour( a[10]{}, sizeof(a[40]) --> not ub)
